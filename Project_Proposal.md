# PONG

Team Members: Peyton, Nicole

## App Idea

 Our game stems from the table game “Ping Pong” and has two players with “paddles” on the side competing to score the ball into the opponents goal. As time goes by, random power ups will appear for both characters that will give them an advantage over their opponent. This version of the game will also have the ping pong ball curve to the direction the player wants it to–this is a replacement for the standard linear trajectory the game had.

## 2. Target Audience

 This game is targeted towards people that are 6-19 years old. Although the added features give a sense of complexity for experienced gamers, this game is also open to people with little to no gaming experience. Since this game is designed from the typical table ping pong, individuals who enjoy this game also enjoy playing with friends, have a competitive nature, and like games that challenge quick thinking skills.

## 3. Goals and Vision

 This game should satisfy beginner gamers while also adding elements that challenge experienced players. This game should also incite quick reflexes and thinking, while also having fun and getting competitive with other players.

## 4. Key Features

    •   Two-player game so that the game primarily revolves around playing with an opponent
    •   Power-ups that allows players to temporarily gain an advantage over their opponent(every power-up has a different advantage and ability)
    •   Score Keeper so that the players have a way to see who is winning
    •   “Paddles”  which will two walls (one per player) that will act as the paddles for the ball to bounce off of
    •   Ball  which will be the object that the players are trying to score into the opponents’ goal
    •  Trajectory this will make it so the player can influence the direction the ball will bounce off their “paddle” instead of the standard linear path
    •  End of the game Pop Up  this will ask the player if they want to rematch with the same player after the match is over, or go back to the main menu
    •  Stopping Point the players will be trying to be the first with 11 points, each goal counting as 1 point. After 11 points are reached, the game is over

## 5. Success Criteria

This game will be considered a hit if it runs without any bugs and both players have fun in a fair and exciting environment. This game should be accessible to beginner and master gamers and overall an entertaining game.

## 6. Technical Requirements

This game will be accessible on almost every platform. Every platform will have a standard 60 frames per second, except mobile which will have 30 frames per second.

On PC, you can use both a mouse and a keyboard to control the paddle and the trajectory of the ball, although if there are two players playing locally, there are two options: connect two mice and use the “wasd” and arrow keys to control the paddles, or eliminate the mice and purely play on just the keyboard.

As for mobile games, this platform will have a swipe command to control the paddles and ball direction. In this case, two players on the same mobile device will have designated sides for each player to swipe on.

For console players, they will use a joystick to control both the paddle and the direction of the ball. For two players to play locally on one console, they will have to connect two controllers to the gaming console.

After every game, you will have the option to play again or go back to main menu which is just the start screen.
