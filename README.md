# **Pong**

## **Project Description**

This is a redo of the classic atari pong game, which has a menu with an option to change the background and practice in addition to the main game mode. In the game mode, there will be two players with standard paddles who will have the chance to collect power-ups that randomize on the screen, while also influencing the curvature of the ball

## Installation Instructions

1. Download these files from the repository
2. Open the folder with the name “PONG GAME”
3. Double click on it, and boom you're set!

## Usage Instructions

PC: you will choose from the menu what you want to do with your mouse, and when entering the practice mode or main gamemode, you will have the option to either control your paddle with the mouse or the WASD/arrow keys. Up and down actions will only move the paddles, the left and right arrows will influence the curve motion of the ball. The game will end once a player reaches 11 points. Although, the practice gives you the liberty to choose how many points you want to play. Have fun!

Tablet & Phone: these platforms will have the same controls, although they will have a touch screen swiping any direction they want.
