# Game Name: PONG

Team Members: Peyton, Nicole

## Game Overview

PONG is a reinvention of the classic atari game with power ups, curve and speed change, and a new fresh look!
The main goal is for one player to reach 11 points first. The two players will be competing against each other to reach that goal point. They will also be trying to get as many power-ups as they can so they have a better chance of scoring a point.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features

     •    Keep track of scores
     •    Integrate random power ups throughout the game(charge up and blast your opponent with the ball, freeze opponent for a few seconds, make “paddles” invisible, etc)
     •    Pop up at the end of the game to ask the player for a rematch or back to main menu
     •    curving trajectory for ball (controlled by the players)

### User Interactions

Depending on the platform there will be different forms to interact with the game. On PC, they have the choice to use the mouse and keyboard, or just the keyboard. On mobile, it will be a touch screen mechanism. On gaming consoles, they will use the joysticks on controllers to interact with the game.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Usability

The game should be designed in order for the player to take full advantage of the paddle, and to use it effectively and efficiently with precision.

### Performance

    The game should come with customizable options for PC. Low, medium and high adjustable settings for graphics, and should be defaulted to 60 fps. On all high settings.

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

    •PC, Mobile, and Consoles.

## Design Requirements

### Graphics and Visuals

    •The style will be attributed to the themes of the maps, but the overall style present will take inspiration from both pixelated arts, and anime of the 90s to give a mix of appealing action, but with a familiar video game look.
    •The audio will be a mix of both chiptune, rock, hip hop, and electronic. The sound effects used for the game will be primarily based on sci-fi fantasy-like sounds.

## Data Requirements

High Scores, Wins, Progress, are some of the things that we need to be able to created our app with efficient saving.
Data will be stored in-game memory through local files.

We will Record all changes down and show them to the client, that way they can look over the changes and what to improve and to change, as well as playtesting with the client.
